A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the 
data efficiently and effectively. 
The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. 
An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used 
to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. 
To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.

The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially. 
The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:

Learn about Time and Space complexities
Learn the basics of individual Data Structures
Learn the basics of Algorithms
